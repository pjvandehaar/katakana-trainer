Build me a tiny flashcards webapp for practicing katakana.

It has 3 "pages" (even though they're all in one index.html):

1. The start page.
   It says "Katakana Trainer!" at the top.
   Below that, it has a "Start!" button.
   Below that, it shows the 5 x 10 grid of katakana.  This is reasonably compact, so that it fits on one screen.
   You may reference the katakana grid at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana>.
   Make sure the rows and columns are right.  "*u" must always be the center column, etc.
   Make "n" be full-width, so that it's clear that it's not one of the vowels.
   Also add a tiny note about ' and º below the katakana guide.

2. The flashcard page.
   It shows a flashcard.
   The top is a word in katakana.  The word is a cognate of an English word.  Eg, "Batman" (but in katakana).
   Below that is a text box where you type the word in English, with a "Submit!" button.  It also handles ENTER.
   Below that, de-emphasized, is a button "Show katakana cheat sheet".  It pops up a modal of the katakana.  The modal has an "x" and also handles ESC.
   When you submit:
   - If you're correct: you see (above the flashcard) "Correct!" (just for a moment).
   - If you're wrong: you see "Wrong! ワイン is "wine".  ワ(WA)    イ (I)    ン (N).  Please type it and hit submit to continue."  Make sure to handle every katakana that appears in the list of cognates.
   Then it shows the next flashcard.  There are 10.
   Ideally, this would have a cute animation.  Maybe the flashcard zips away to the left, and a new one sweeps in from the right.
   Ideally, "Correct!"/"Wrong, ..." would fly down from the top of the screen and slap on top of the flashcard at a slight angle.  Imagine a clerk stamping a form.

3. The final score.  "Finished!  You got 6/10 correct!"
   If you ever used the cheat sheet, it appends "but you used the cheat sheet 3 times!"



To find cognates:
 - Check these pages:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gairaigo_and_wasei-eigo_terms
    - https://www.thoughtco.com/most-common-loan-words-in-japanese-2027852
    - https://www.japanesepod101.com/blog/2021/05/13/english-loanwords-in-japanese/
 - Make sure they are cognates in English.  Some (eg "pan") are just Spanish.
 - If they are abbreviated, use the abbreviated form.  Eg, "マイク" = "mic", not "microphone".


How:
 - This will be a static site.  No server-side code.
 - Please just make index.html and script.js.


Bonus after you finish everything else:
 - Add `node test.js` which imports some functions from script.js and tests them.
 - Add more styling.  Use a pretty light blue sunny theme.
 - When grading answers, use some kind of fuzzy logic.  Maybe levenshtein distance?
 - Use localstorage to track previous sessions and previously-seen words.  Avoid words that the user got correct.  Mix in words that the user got wrong.
 - At the end, offer a view of all words, whether you've seen them, and whether you got them right.  De-emphasize this in a footer or something.
